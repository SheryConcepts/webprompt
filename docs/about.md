<product-description>
This browser extension introduces a command-line interface directly within the web browser. Upon activation via a user-defined keyboard shortcut, a prominent inqput UI appears at the top center of the current webpage. This input field serves as the entry point for executing commands.

The extension provides a dynamic, scrollable list of available commands, offering users immediate discoverability and the ability to navigate through options using the keyboard or mouse. Users can also directly type commands into the input field, benefiting from potential autocompletion as the command library grows.

The core functionality includes a comprehensive set of built-in browser commands, mirroring common actions such as:

* Opening new tabs
* Accessing browser history
* Managing bookmarks
* Reloading pages
* Navigating back and forward
* Controlling tab behavior (pinning, muting)
* Adjusting zoom levels

Crucially, the extension is designed for extensibility. It allows for the creation and execution of more specialized commands that interact with the content and functionality of webpages. Examples of such extended commands include:

* **Downloading the current webpage as Markdown:** Converting the HTML content into a Markdown format and saving it as a file.
* **Activating a reading mode:** Extracting the main article content and displaying it in a simplified, distraction-free format.
* **[Placeholder for other potential extended commands based on our previous discussions]**

The development of this extension leverages the **WXT (Web Extension Toolkit) framework**. WXT streamlines the build process and provides a modern development experience for building cross-browser extensions.

The primary programming language used throughout the project is **TypeScript**, ensuring type safety, improved code maintainability, and enhanced developer productivity.

The user interface for managing the extension's commands, accessible via the extension's icon as a popup, will be built using the **React** library. React's component-based architecture will enable the creation of a dynamic and user-friendly interface for viewing, modifying, and adding both built-in and custom commands. This UI will allow users to tailor the browser's behavior to their specific needs and workflows.

The extension is intended to be open source, fostering a community-driven ecosystem where users and developers can contribute new commands and enhance its capabilities. This collaborative approach, combined with the robust tech stack of WXT, TypeScript, and React, will lead to a constantly expanding library of useful and innovative browser actions.

The primary goal of this extension is to enhance user efficiency and provide a powerful, keyboard-centric alternative to traditional mouse-driven browser interactions. By centralizing actions and allowing for extensive customization through a modern UI built with React, it aims to empower users to interact with the web in a more direct and productive manner.
